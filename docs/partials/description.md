`<auro-loader>` is a [HTML custom element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) for the purpose of illustrating animated loaders.

Things take time. Sometimes we just need to take a second for some data to show up. For this Auro supports the `<auro-loader>` custom element. This powerful element supports multiple modes for use, `ringworm`, `orbit`, `pulse`, and `laser`.

And each of these modes support five size settings, `default`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl`.

For color support `<auro-loader>` supports `currentColor`, this allows for any color set on the parent element to influence the color of the loader.

The `<auro-loader>` custom element also supports two pre-defined appearance modes: `appearance="brand"` and `appearance="inverse"`.
